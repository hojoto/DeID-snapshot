Record date: [REDACTED]
ID: The patient is a [REDACTED] yr old woman with multiple medical problems, who comes in after recent [REDACTED] month hospitalization for followup and to review recent course of events.



HPI:  I had last seen her in [REDACTED] at which time her DM was being treated with [REDACTED] 10 units, and [REDACTED] 10 mg bid.  Her [REDACTED] had been held as had her [REDACTED] due to elevated LFT's, and her [REDACTED] had been discontinued by her neurologist.  Her LFT's had come down from her hospitalization in [REDACTED] but were still elevated at AST [REDACTED] and ALT [REDACTED].  Liver biopsy was being considered by Dr. [REDACTED], her gastroenterologist.  She also had been recently hospitalized at [REDACTED] for syncope with history of partial seizure disorder vs TIA with history of transient episodes of right arm numbness and weakness dating to [REDACTED] but with no seizures in [REDACTED] yrs.



In [REDACTED] she had several episodes of syncope, one of which occured in her neurologist's office.    She was apparently hypotensive and initially refused to go to the ED, but later her family brought her to the ED at [REDACTED].  She was found to be bacteremic with [REDACTED] and was treated with IV [REDACTED].   Endovascular sources were found to be negative as source, as was a knee tap, and no source was ever identified.  She was transferred to [REDACTED] in [REDACTED].   She had severe back pain and two bone biopsies were negative for osteomyelitis in the spine.  She was also found to have a [REDACTED] compression fracture of T4 and this was treated at [REDACTED] with a T4 vertebroplasty in [REDACTED].  She also was worked up for mets to spine but only benign hemangiomas were found.



She was discharged to rehab in mid [REDACTED].  She required at least two more admissions from rehab to [REDACTED] over the next two months.  She apparently had severe gastroparesis and was unable to eat, requiring portacath for TPN around [REDACTED].  She had then gone back to rehab again but was readmitted with DVT of the left Subclavian vein around the site of the Portacath.  She was started on [REDACTED] and was back in rehab for another few weeks.  The arm swelling quickly resolved. There was also reportedly a TIA which occured after an MRI scan with right facial droop and slurred speech at [REDACTED].  She was finally discharged to home on [REDACTED].



MEDS:  [REDACTED] 7.5 mg qd,  [REDACTED] 10 mg qd, [REDACTED] 20 mg tid, [REDACTED] 300 mg po bid, [REDACTED] 75 mg po qd, [REDACTED] 20 mg qd, [REDACTED] 1 mg qd, [REDACTED] 50 mcg qd, [REDACTED] 200 mg bid, [REDACTED] 2.5 mg po qd, [REDACTED] inhaler prn, [REDACTED] 250 bid, [REDACTED] 50 mg q 6hrs prn, MVI, [REDACTED] 1000.

A/P:  [REDACTED] yr old woman with multiple medical problems, s/p [REDACTED] month hospitalization.



1)  Diabetes.  Throughout her hospitalization she lost a lot of weight down from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] last spring to current level of [REDACTED] lbs.  Insulin was stopped and just recently [REDACTED] 2.5 mg added on.  Recent Hg A1C obtained after this visit on [REDACTED] was [REDACTED].  Bun /Cr was [REDACTED]/[REDACTED].  glucose [REDACTED].  Cholesterol [REDACTED]/[REDACTED]/[REDACTED].  LFT's were not done and need to be done, will be ordered next lab draw.  If normalized then will add back [REDACTED].  History of gastroparesis, on new med has replaced [REDACTED], doing better.



2)  Hypertension.  Doing well on [REDACTED] 10, [REDACTED] 200 bid and [REDACTED] 20 tid.



3)  S/p recent upper extremity DVT, on [REDACTED].  Per Dr. [REDACTED]'s note of [REDACTED], she needs [REDACTED] months of anticoag, and then [REDACTED]mg/day until the portacath discontinued.  With history [REDACTED] prior DVT's will need to discuss whether she should be on long term therapy.  She is now getting FS INR's thru the VNA, but will be transitioned to Internal Medicine, with access thru the portacath, or continued FS's.  INR has been in good range with [REDACTED] mg [REDACTED].



4)  S/P  compression fracture of T4, s/p vertebroplasty with successful resolution of the pain.  Has other compression fractures but not interested in further procedures at this time.



5)  History of hypothyroidism.  Had recent labs at [REDACTED] on  [REDACTED] with TSH of [REDACTED] and Free T4 of  [REDACTED].  



6)  History of anemia, requiring [REDACTED] and ? transfusions during her hospitalizations, with normal hct of [REDACTED] on  [REDACTED].



7)  Neuro;  History of partial seizures, TIA's.  Followed by Dr. [REDACTED].    History of silent cerebellar brain infarction on MRI.    History of moderate intracranial carotid stenosis, with recent ? TIA left hemisphere, ? repeat carotid noninvasives per Dr. [REDACTED] vs CT angiogram.  On [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].  Per Dr. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] alone would be enough for stroke prophylaxis, and he would defer to Dr. [REDACTED] as to whether to continue [REDACTED].



8)  History of elevated LFT's.  May have been medication related, due to [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED].  Now off all meds, need redo as above, and consideration if normal of retrial of  statin.
