Record date: [REDACTED]


[REDACTED]


Follow up after long absence. Pt was seen last week by Dr.[REDACTED] and prior to that she was at [REDACTED] ED and prior to that her son reports that she had been in [REDACTED]. I suspect she has been under someone else's care since I never prescribed [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. The last  time I saw her in January I discontinued  [REDACTED] because of GI intolerance and her regimen was [REDACTED] only. She did not keep subsequent appointments.


She was seen at [REDACTED] ED because of [REDACTED]/[REDACTED] treated with [REDACTED] and discharged on [REDACTED]. She has now completed the treatment. She feels better although there is still mild [REDACTED], denies chills and fever. course
